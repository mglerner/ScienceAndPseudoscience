Science And Pseudoscience
=======================

Highly influenced by Alan Peel's [course][APC] at the University of
Maryland. Also a [course][TSM] on the scientific method at SMU and
perhaps a psychology [course][PsychPseudo]

To start off with, what's the difference between science and
pseudoscience? Michael Shermer has a nice
[article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-pseudoscience/). 


Required textbooks

  * Michael Shermer's [Why People Believe Weird Things][WPBWT]
  * Randall Munroe's [what if?][whatif]
  * Cordeila Fine's [A Mind of Its Own: How your Brain Distorts and Deceives][AMoIO]
  * Madsen Pirie's
  [How to Win Every Argument: The Use and Abuse of Logic][HowToWin]
  * We'll also listen to several [You are not so smart][YNNS] podcasts.

Recommended textbooks

 * Schick and Vaughn's [How to Think About Weird Things][HowToThink]
 * Ellenberg's [How Not to Be Wrong][HowNotToBeWrong]
